**QMS Baseline Study** 

In order to support STE Oil in their goal to implement an ISO9001:2015 certified Quality Management System (QMS), I undertook a high-level gap assessment of their current business practices against the requirements of the standard.  The gap assessment acted as a baseline study in order to produce a ‘Road Map to Certification’ for the company.



**QMS ‘Lite’ Implementation Project**  

Working with STE Oil to build a ‘lite’ management system using good practice from ISO9001:2015.  The project follows a two-phase approach 1) Stakeholder Assessment, Senior Management Workshops (including Strengths, Weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT) Assessment and Risk Assessment), Worksite Engagement Workshop (inc. SWOT).  The workshops will ultimately produce a list of documents which will form the basis of the STE Oil QMS Lite Manual and 2) Continua will draft the manual in collaboration with STE Oil.  The manual will be kept to a manageable size to ensure ease of implementation by the organization.
